# pymoo

In this task, we use NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithm to solve some optimization problems:
* Module: https://pymoo.org/ \
* NSGA-II instruction with pymoo: https://pymoo.org/algorithms/nsga2.html \
* MOEA/D instruction with pymoo: https://pymoo.org/algorithms/moead.html \
* Unconstrained problems: ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4, ZDT6 (https://pymoo.org/problems/multi/zdt.html) \
* Constrained problems: DASCMOP1-6 (https://pymoo.org/problems/constrained/dascmop.html) \

Experiment: Try tuning some parameters such as: population size and the number of generations (n_gen) of NSGA-II and MOEA/D in order to compare performance of algorithms on each problem (with guarantee that the number_of_evaluations of every algoritm is the same). Refer this [link](https://pymoo.org/misc/performance_indicator.html) to understand how to showcase how far Pareto front of the results is compared to the optimal Pareto front and related measurement.
